Just because the language has support for various features doesn't mean it should.  

Comments, they take up space.  Almost always indicate that your code isn't understandable enough on it's own and requires non-logic to explain.  Or worse yet someone on your project has enforced a stupid rule "EVERYTHING MUST BE COMMENTED" and forced that through a build process tool...

Heck, GhostDoc is a commercial product!!  LOOK!  If a developer made a tool to automaticly come up with comments so that the other developer tool that checks for those comments will pass it up.....was there any gain here?!  rhetorical question....NO!


Let's build a list of tools to analyse your code for Styling errors and create rules that help support a more modern way of programming and not the constant repeition of shit someone came up with 30 years ago when working with older languages that had severe limitations on variable name lengths, line lengths, poorer compilers.
